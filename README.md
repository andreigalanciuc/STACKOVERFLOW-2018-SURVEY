## SOFTWARE REQUIREMENTS

## PROJECT MOTIVATION
I am researching the data set of STACKOVERFLOW 2018 Survey. I am trying to see how formal education affects salaries for developers. 
I am also looking for characteristics of developers, like their formal education.

## FILE DESCRIPTIONS
The files for this project can be found on Kaggle.

## RESULTS
To my surprise, FORMAL EDUCATION is not a predictor for salaries at all. There was no variation in salaries explained by formal education.
The most common majors of tech workers (software engineers, data scientists, web designers etc.) are in natural sciences (biology, physics etc.)
Most respondents see themselves in a more specialized role within five years, and many of them see themselves founding a company.
